    Note about the above test failing with the test method having assertTrue(error.getMessage().contains("which is not divisible by 3"), "Error message should mention not divisible");

    Answer:
    The test `shouldNotMatchNonDivisibleNumberV2` in `EnglishDivisibleByMatcherTest` is failing because the assertion:

```java
assertTrue(error.getMessage().contains("which is not divisible by 3"), "Error message should mention not divisible");
```

is not satisfied. This means the `AssertionError` message produced by Hamcrest when `assertThat(10, divisibleBy(3))` fails does **not** contain the substring `"which is not divisible by 3"`.

**Reason:**
Hamcrest's default error message for a failed matcher includes the expected description (from `describeTo`) and the mismatch description (from `describeMismatchSafely`). However, depending on how Hamcrest formats the error, the message may not include the exact phrase `"which is not divisible by 3"`. It could be formatted differently, e.g.,

```
Expected: a number divisible by <3>
     but: was <10>, which is not divisible by <3>
```

or sometimes only the expected part is present, depending on the Hamcrest/JUnit integration.

**How to fix:**
Print the actual error message and adjust the assertion to match the real output, or use a more flexible check (e.g., check for `"not divisible"` instead of the full phrase).

**Summary:**
The test fails because the error message does not contain the exact string `"which is not divisible by 3"`. Adjust the assertion to match the actual error message.
